        <h2>My skills</h2>  
<p>
    I am very eager to learn about graphic designing, coding, making connecting things. <br /> 
    Since 2019 I started to learn and work on Adobe products that include Adobe Photoshop, <br />
     Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro. <br />
     Even with 5 years of using these softwares, I'm still at the learning stage. The learning curve is so deep.    <br />
     Here are one of each of my works:
