    <p>Hello, my name is Khurelsukh Odgerel. My friends call me Hurlee. I was born in 2004 March 23rd. I'm currently an student in National
        University of Mongolia. I'm a Junior. I live in HUD 15 2102. My favorite meal is anything that includes meat meat. I have somewhat the idea of coding and making stuff.

    <h2>My skills</h2>  
    <p>
        I am very eager to learn about graphic designing, coding, making connecting things. <br /> 
        Since 2019 I started to learn and work on Adobe products that include Adobe Photoshop, <br />
         Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro. <br />
         Even with 5 years of using these softwares, I'm still at the learning stage. The learning curve is so deep.    <br />
         Here are one of each of my works:
